 # Xcopy-Command-Aplication
Hello, this project was made by the idea of making the classic cmd command XCOPY with its parameters to be more easy to use.
so i made a application with a visual interface in c# language containing buttons and paths and a list with parameters so the command is easier to use 
like this rather then opening the command prompt
